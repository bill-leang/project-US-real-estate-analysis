## Overview

For this project, we explored facets of the Nasdaq Zillow API dataset and performed 3 different analyses to unravel interesting trends in the USA real estate market. Zillow is regarded as the "leading real estate and rental marketplace" with its API built around various market indicators and containing more than 20 years worth of data for "thousands of geographical areas" covering the United States.

Our analyses explore the following topics:
    1. Effect of Seasonal Changes on Real Estate Inventory (per USA Region)
    2. Effect of Interest Rate Increases in the USA on Median House Prices
    3. Median House Prices by City Type in USA Over Time

In demonstrating our overall data analysis, we each primarily (but not exclusively) used the following Python libraries:
    1. **Pandas** - Data Wrangling / Cleaning / Aggregation / Analysis
    2. **Matplotlib** - Visualisations of Our Raw / Aggregated Datasets
    3. **SciPy** - Statistical & Hypothesis Testing
