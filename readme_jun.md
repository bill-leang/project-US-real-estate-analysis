## Instructions
__Please follow these instructions before exploring the analysis:__

1. Run all of the code blocks in Jupyter Notebook to ensure that all dataframes and visualizations are created.

2. Each figure is generally followed by an explanation or analysis, sometimes the write-up is in the next figure as they are compared together.

4. The visualizations are only visible from the "Analysis" section.

```
